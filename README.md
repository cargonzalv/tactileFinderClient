# Tactiled Client

Client part of the [Tactile Finder project](https://github.com/cegonzalv/tactileFinder). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project description

[Tactiled](https://tactiled.firebaseapp.com/) is a tool made to test the quality of an image to be used as a tactile graphic. We developed and trained a Machine Learning model that determines the quality of an image that will be transformed to a tactile graphic, by evaluating the facility for a blind person to understand its content


## Functionalities

1. Find tactile-graphic-friendly images: Search any type of image you want with our custom search engine! You can put any category you want, we will take care of providing you just with the ones that are good for tactile graphic usage.
2. Test your own image for tactile-friendliness: You can upload your own image to the page and get a result instantly on how good it would be on a tactile graphic.
3. Retrain the model: (Just for the experts) Go to the "train our model" section and begin swiping left and right, depending if an image is tactile-friendly or not.
